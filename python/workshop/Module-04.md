# Module 04 - Multi-Agent Orchestration

[< Agent Specialization](./Module-03.md) - **[Home](Home.md)** - [Lessons Learned, Agent Futures, Q&A >](./Module-05.md)

## Introduction

In this Module you'll learn how to implement the multi-agent orchestration to tie all of the agents you have created so far together into a single system. You'll also learn how to test the system as a whole is working correctly and how to debug and monitor the agents performance and behavior and troubleshoot them.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to write prompts for agents
- Define agent routing
- Learn how to define API contracts for a multi-agent system
- Learn how to test and debug agents, monitoring

## Module Exercises

1. [Activity 1: Session on Multi-Agent Architectures](#activity-1-session-on-multi-agent-architectures)
1. [Activity 2: Define Agents and Roles](#activity-2-define-agents-and-roles)
1. [Activity 3: Session on Testing and Monitoring](#activity-3-session-on-testing-and-monitoring)
1. [Activity 4: Implement Agent Tracing and Monitoring](#activity-4-implement-agent-tracing-and-monitoring)
1. [Activity 5: Test your Work](#activity-5-test-your-work)

## Activity 1: Session on Multi-Agent Architectures

In this session you will learn how this all comes together and get insights into how the multi-agent orchestration works and coordindates across all of the defined agents for your system.

## Activity 2: Define Agents and Roles

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to write prompts for agents and define agent routing.

**TBD - this needs langauge specific instructions**

## Activity 3: Session on Testing and Monitoring

In this session you will learn about how to architect the service layer for a multi-agent system and how to configure and coduct testing and debugging and monitoring for these systems.

## Activity 4: Implement Agent Tracing and Monitoring

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to define an API service layer for a multi-agent backend and learn how to configure tracing and monitoring to enable testing and debugging for agents.

**TBD - this needs langauge specific instructions**

## Activity 5: Test your Work

With the hands-on exercises complete it is time to test your work.
