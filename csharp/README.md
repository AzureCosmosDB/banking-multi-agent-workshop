# Build a Multi-Agent AI application using C# and Semantic Kernel

This is a sample that exposes turn-by-turn conversation with a multi-agent banking application using the Azure OpenAI gpt-4o model, via REST API delivered through FastAPI that stores chat history and message state in Azure Cosmos DB. The agents are implemented using Semantic Kernel and C#. Each agent is a state machine that can handle a few banking-related tasks.
