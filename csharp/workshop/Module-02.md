# Module 02 - Connecting Agents to Memory

[< Creating Your First Agent](./Module-01.md) - **[Home](Home.md)** - [Agent Specialization >](./Module-03.md)

## Introduction

In this Module you'll connect your agent to Azure Cosmos DB to provide memory for chat history and state management for your agents to provide durability and context-awareness in your agent interactions.


## Learning Objectives and Activities

- Learn the basics for Azure Cosmos DB for storing state and chat history
- Learn how to integrate agent framworks to Azure Cosmos DB
- Test connectivity to Azure Cosmos DB works

## Module Exercises

1. [Activity 1: Session Memory Persistence in Agent Frameworks](#activity-1-session-memory-persistence-in-agent-frameworks)
1. [Activity 2: Connecting Agent Frameworks to Azure Cosmos DB](#activity-2-connecting-agent-frameworks-to-azure-cosmos-db)
1. [Activity 3: Test your Work](#activity-5-test-your-work)


## Activity 1: Session Memory Persistence in Agent Frameworks

In this session you will get an overview of memory and how it works for Semantic Kernel Agents and LangGraph and learn the basics for how to configure and connect both to Azure Cosmos DB as a memory store for both chat history and/or state management.


## Activity 2: Connecting Agent Frameworks to Azure Cosmos DB

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to initialize Azure Cosmos DB and integrate with an agent framework to provide persistent memory for chat history and state management.

**TBD - this needs langauge specific instructions**

## Activity 3: Test your Work

With the hands-on exercises complete it is time to test your work.

**TBD - this needs langauge specific instructions**

### Validation Checklist

Your implementation is successful if:

- [ ] Your app compiles with no warnings or errors.
- [ ] Your agent successfully connects to Azure Cosmos DB. (**TBD how do we test this?**)
