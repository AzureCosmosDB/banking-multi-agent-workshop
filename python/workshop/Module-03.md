# Module 03 - Agent Specialization

[< Connecting Agents to Memory](./Module-02.md) - **[Home](Home.md)** - [Multi-Agent Orchestration >](./Module-04.md)


## Introduction

In this Module you'll learn how to implement agent specialization by creating Semantic Kernel Functions or LangGraph Tools that provide the functionality necessary to power individual agents that comprise a multi-agent system.


## Learning Objectives and Activities

- Learn the basics for Semantic Kernel Agent Framework Functions and LangGraph Tools
- Learn how to implement semantic and natural language features using Vector indexing and search integration from Azure Cosmos DB.
- Learn how to define tasks and communication protocols for seamless collaboration.

## Activity 1: Session on Agent Specialization and Integration

In this session we will dive into how to create Semantic Kernel Agent Framework Functions or LangGraph Tools to connect agents to external APIs, databases and third-party tools to provide special functionality. Learn the basics for vector indexing and search in Azure Cosmos DB to provide semantic search functionality to your agents. Learn how to define tasks and communication protocols for seamless collaboration between agents.


## Activity 6: Test your Work

With the hands-on exercises complete it is time to test your work.

**TBD - this needs langauge specific instructions**

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Account Balance agent functions correctly
- [ ] Semantic Search for Product Agent functions correctly
- [ ] Service Request agent successfully creates a new service request on behalf of user
- [ ] New Service request is correctly read by second service request agent
