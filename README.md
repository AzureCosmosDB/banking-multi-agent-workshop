# 🏦 Banking Multi-Agent Workshop

Welcome! 👋 We're excited to have you here. This repository contains a comprehensive multi-agent banking application that demonstrates how AI agents can collaborate to handle complex retail banking scenarios.

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

Build intelligent, collaborative AI agents that work together to solve real-world banking challenges. Choose your preferred programming language (C# or Python) and session length to match your schedule and learning goals.

## 📚 Workshop Formats

We offer two flexible learning paths:

| Format | Duration | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Hands-On Lab (HOL)** | 2 hours | Quick introduction, time-constrained sessions |
| **Workshop** | 8 hours | Deep dive, comprehensive understanding |

The application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Choose Your Path

Each implementation is available as a separate branch. Select the one that best fits your needs:

#### Current Versions
- **`HOL_v2_AFandLangGraph`** - Short hands-on lab using Microsoft Agent Framework and LangGraph

- **`WorkShop_v1_SKandLangGraph`** - Earlier workshop version with Semantic Kernel

### Repository Structure

Each branch contains two main folders:

```
📁 01_exercises/
   ├── Starter code to build upon
   └── Step-by-step instructions to guide you

📁 02_completed/
   └── Fully working solution for demos and reference
```

### Next Steps

1. **Select your branch** - Choose from the options above based on your format preference and desired technology stack
2. **Navigate to `01_exercises`** - Start building with guided instructions
3. **Reference `02_completed`** - Check the complete implementation whenever needed
