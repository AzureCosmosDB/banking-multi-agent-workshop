# Module 01 - Creating Your First Agent

[< Deployment and Setup](./Module-00.md) - **[Home](Home.md)** - [Connecting Agents to Memory >](./Module-02.md)

## Introduction

In this Module, you'll implement your first agent as part of a multi-agent banking system implemented using either Semantic Kernel Agent Framwork or LangGraph. You will get an introduction to Semantic Kernel and LangChain frameworks and their plug-in/tool integration with OpenAI for generating completions.

## Learning Objectives and Activities

- Learn the basics for Semantic Kernel Agent Framework and LangGraph
- Learn how to integrate agent framworks to Azure OpenAI
- Build a simple chat agent

## Module Exercises

1. [Activity 1: Session on Single-agent architecture](#activity-1-session-on-single-agent-architecture)
1. [Activity 2: Session on Semantic Kernel Agent Framework and LangGraph](#activity-2-session-on-semantic-kernel-agent-framework-and-langgraph)
1. [Activity 3: Instantiate Agent Framework and Connect to Azure OpenAI](#activity-3-instantiate-agent-framework-and-connect-to-azure-openai)
1. [Activity 4: Create a Simple Customer Service Agent](#activity-4-create-a-simple-customer-service-agent)
1. [Activity 5: Test your Work](#activity-5-test-your-work)

## Activity 1: Session on Single-agent architecture

In this session you will get an overview of Semantic Kernel Agents and LangGraph and learn the basics for how to build a chat app that interacts with a user and generations completions using an LLM powered by Azure OpenAI.

## Activity 2: Session on Semantic Kernel Agent Framework and LangGraph

In this session ou will get a deeper introduction into the Semantic Kernel Agent Frameowkr and LangGraph with details on how to implement plug-in or tool integration with Azure Open AI.


## Activity 3: Instantiate Agent Framework and Connect to Azure OpenAI

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to initialize an agent framework and integrate it with a large langugage model.

**TBD - this needs langauge specific instructions**


## Activity 4: Create a Simple Customer Service Agent

In this hands-on exercise, you will create a simple customer service agent that users interact with and generates completions using a large language model.

**TBD - this needs langauge specific instructions**


## Activity 5: Test your Work

With the hands-on exercises complete it is time to test your work.

**TBD - this needs langauge specific instructions**


### Validation Checklist

Your implementation is successful if:

- [ ] Your app compiles with no warnings or errors.
- [ ] Your agent successfully processes user input and generates and appropriate response.
